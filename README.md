# Transitioning from Interface Builder to SwiftUI (INCLUDES VIDEO!)
This repo represents just a starting point for my series of video tutorials meant to guide people still using Interface Builder and Auto Layout into becoming proficient in Apple's new user interface paradigm, SwiftUI. Instead of plunging straight into SwiftUI code, I highlight some similarities between SwiftUI and Interface Builder with Auto Layout, as well as discuss how the two technologies diverge. I remind you about building a login form in Interface Builder and then do it in SwiftUI -- and show you the two forms' code side-by-side. I'll give you a basic overview for starting to use SwiftUI. If you're new to SwiftUI, this video is for you. 

**NOTE:** This repo creates a simple login form built with Interface Builder to contrast with SwiftUI (it was written using Xcode 14.2 and Swift 5.7). The SwiftUI version of this login form is contained in my [_next_](https://github.com/iosbrain/SwiftUI-based-login-form) repo. Enjoy!
